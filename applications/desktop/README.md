Checkout our [Medium blog post](https://medium.com/nteract/nteract-revolutionizing-the-notebook-experience-d106ca5d2c38) to see what amazing things you can do with nteract.

Note: There will be :bug:s and quirks. Please come tell us about them!

nteract is a literate coding environment that supports Python, R, JavaScript and [other Jupyter kernels](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels). It wraps up the best of the web based Jupyter notebook and embeds it as a desktop application that allows you to open notebooks natively on your system. Double click a `.ipynb` on the desktop, use Spotlight on the Mac. It Just Works™
